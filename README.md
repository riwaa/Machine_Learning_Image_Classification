# mnist_classification

This project explore the MNIST dataset and with various classification methods.

### Naive Bayes
* tested the difference between `bernoulli naive bayes` vs. `multinomial naive bayes` vs. `Gaussian naive bayes`
* Wrote and performed `Gaussian Blur` to images to improve the model performance
* Naive Bayes is a generative model. `Used the model to generate the images of corresponding digits.` 


### K Nearest Neighbor
* Explore the model performances various Ks
* Explore the model performances with size of training data
* Use `logistic regression to predict model performance` with really large datasets rather than actually train and fit the model. Actual model will take really long to predict due to the nature of KNN model
