The number of training examples and number of labels is the same. In fact, you can simply replace the code that loads \"fashion_mnist\" with \"mnist\" and everything should work fine."

    "Recall that a strongly calibrated classifier is rougly 90% accurate when the posterior probability of the predicted class is 0.9. A weakly calibrated classifier is more accurate when the posterior probability of the predicted class is 90% than when it is 80%. A poorly calibrated classifier has no positive correlation between posterior probability and accuracy.  \n",

Evaluate performance: partition the dev set into several buckets based on the posterior probabilities of the predicted classes - think of a bin in a histogram- and then estimate the accuracy for each bucket. So, for each prediction, find the bucket to which the maximum posterior probability belongs, and update \"correct\" and \"total\" counters accordingly.  Show the accuracy for each bucket.\n",
